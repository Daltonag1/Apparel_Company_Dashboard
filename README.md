<p align="left">In this Project, you will find a simple dashboard analyzing bike sales consulting 1000 people. To understand if they did o didn't buy a bike, information such as income, occupation, age, commute to work, etc. was gathered.

This project was one of the assignments I had to create for a Data Science course I did a year back.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Data Transformation / Cleaning
#### All data transformation and cleaning was made within the Excel file as follows:

- There was no data cleaning to be made, since the assigments was mainly focused evaluating Excel formula's knowledge.

- "Integrated Sheets" sheet was created, were all information from the rest of the sheets was integrated using VLOOKUPS and HLOOKUPS. With this final sheet, the dashboard was ready to be created.

## Dashboard Creation

#### Since this dashboard was created in Looker Studio, PDF's were loaded, prevnting the interactive features. Here's a link to the dashboard

#### The following metrics are the ones being analyzed. Needless to say, there's much more metrics that we can analyze, but we can have a pretty good overview of what the survey has to offer:

- Total Sales and Orders Delivered.

- Monthly sales.

- Sales by Article and by category.

- Top 5 Customers and Countries.

- Top 5 Countries + Customers.

- Top 5 Customers by Country.

## Conclusions Made From Metrics
#### Looking at the Dashboard, here's some of the conclusions we can get:

- There isn't an article that is sold much more than the rest. All articles are sold almost equally. There's a slight revenue increase in Sweatpants. This may indicate that the company sells in bulk to the different clients, offering the same amount of articles for each category.

- The first 3 months of the year have much higher sales than the rest of the year. I believe that clients make a big buy for the entire season on the first months and just re-stock thoughout the rest of the year.
